Welcome to project *nettobac*, a [FreeBASIC
(FB)](http://www.freebasic.net) extension to handle network
connections. It is implemented in OOP (object orientated programming)
as classes, designed to get included in users source code at module
level. It provides features to handle network transfer similar to FB
file access like

- `OPEN` and `CLOSE` network connections
- `PUT` (= send) or `GET` (= receive) data thereover

The package is [hosted at GitHub](https://github.com/DTJF/nettobac) and it contains

- the source code in folder *src/bas*
  - the *nettobac* classes
  - utility functions for http protocol
  - two examples for client and server usage
- the configuration files to build the documentation in folder *doxy*
- the documentation context in .md files in folder *src/doc*
- CMake scripts to build several targets (ie. all, doc, doc_htm, doc_pdf)

Simplificator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/als/) and
[SNC](http://www.freebasic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=p206316).

generator](http://www.doxygen.org/) from FB source code by
