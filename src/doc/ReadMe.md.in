Welcome to project *@PROJ_NAME@*, a tool to generate FreeBASIC (FB)
header files for libraries based on
[GOject-Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/),
which is a middleware layer between C libraries (using GObject) and
language bindings. The C library can be scanned at compile time and
generate a metadata file, in addition to the actual native C library.
*@PROJ_NAME@* can read this metadata and automatically provide FB
bindings to call into the C library.

*@PROJ_NAME@* is the first approach to connect the FreeBasic
programming language to this tool-chain for easy creating and up-dating
FreeBasic header files of GObject based libraries (ie. like GTK, GDA,
GooCanvas, ...).

The package is [hosted at GitHub](@PROJ_WEBS@) and it contains

- the *@PROJ_NAME@* source code in folder *src/bas*
- two examples for client and server usage in folder *src/bas*
- the configuration files to build the documentation in folder *doc*
- the documentation context in .md files in folder *src/doc*
- CMake scripts to build the targets all, doc, doc_htm, doc_pdf
