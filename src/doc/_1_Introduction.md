============

This project is about an extension for the \FB programming language,

- providing classes to act at a network

  - as a server or
  - as a client.

- Network data transfer get handled similar to \FB file access by

  - `nOpen` and `nClose` a connection
  - `nPut` and `nGet` data thereover

- The source code is composed of files

  - `nettobac.bi` header with declarations
  - `nettobac_system.bi` header with system specific declarations
  - `nettobac.bas` source file with function bodies

- Those files have no external dependencies (all is based on the C-run-time library `libc`).

- The code is ready to get included in to users projects.

Additional source code contains

- `nettobac_http.bas`: utility features for http protocol

  - encode and decode texts for request context
  - create several standard http requests
  - handle all steps to download a file

- `example_client.bas`: a client scenario

  - load a html file over the web via http protocol
  - load a gif image file over the web via http protocol
  - load a png image file generated by a php script over the web, custom protocol

- `example_server.bas`: a server scenario

  - open a server port and listen to it
  - connect to clients
  - receive client requests
  - send the data requested by the clients
  - shutdown the server if a clients requests that
